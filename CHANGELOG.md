## 4.0.0 (30 July 2018)

### Breaking changes

- `errors()` for types _array_ and _object_ now returns an object with nested properties instead of dot-separated string properties. Example illustrating changes:

```javascript
const expect = require('@edgeguideab/expect');

expect(
  {
    foo: { type: 'array', items: 'number' },
    bar: { type: 'object', keys: { buzz: 'number' } }
  },
  { foo: [1, '2'], bar: { buzz: '3' } }
).errors(); // { foo: { '1': [ 'Expected parameter foo.1 to be of type number but it was "2"' ] }, bar: { buzz: [ 'Expected parameter bar.buzz to be of type number but it was "3"' ] }Â }
```

## 3.2.0 (26 July 2018)

### Breaking changes

  - NOTE: `number` no longer allows string numbers by default (e.g. "123")
- `maxLength`, `minLength` and `regexp` options have been removed. Replaced by `condition`
- The customized `date` type no longer allows "Invalid Date" when using the `parse` option
